# Testing Guide for Dotfiles Framework

This document provides comprehensive testing strategies for the dotfiles framework to ensure reliability across platforms and components.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Methods

### 1. **Automated Validation Tests**

#### Quick Syntax Validation
```bash
# Run all validation tests
./install.sh --test

# Or run directly
./scripts/test/validate.sh
```

**What it checks:**
- Bash script syntax across all `.sh` files
- YAML configuration file validity  
- Required files existence
- Configuration integrity (theme consistency)
- Symlink target validity
- Install script argument parsing

#### Expected Output:
```
[TEST] Testing Bash script syntax
[PASS] All Bash scripts have valid syntax
[TEST] Testing YAML configuration syntax  
[PASS] All YAML files have valid syntax
...
[SUCCESS] All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

---

### 2. **Dry-Run Testing**

#### Test Without Making Changes
```bash
# Test specific components
./install.sh --shell --dry-run --non-interactive
./install.sh --development --dry-run --non-interactive
./install.sh --desktop --dry-run --non-interactive

# Test full installation
./install.sh --all --dry-run --non-interactive
```

**What it shows:**
- Which packages would be installed
- Which repositories would be added
- Which configuration files would be linked
- Which post-install actions would run

#### Expected Output:
```
[DRY-RUN STEP] Installing shell configuration
[DRY-RUN] Would execute: sudo apt-get install -y zsh
[DRY-RUN] Would execute: create_symlink /path/to/zshrc ~/.zshrc
...
```

### 3. **Docker-Based Testing**

#### Test on Multiple Linux Distributions
```bash
# Test all distributions with shell component
./scripts/test/docker-test.sh all shell

# Test specific distribution interactively
./scripts/test/docker-test.sh interactive ubuntu:22.04

# List available distributions
./scripts/test/docker-test.sh list
```

**Supported Distributions:**
- Ubuntu 22.04, 20.04
- Debian Bullseye
- Arch Linux (latest)
- Fedora 38

**What it tests:**
- Package installation on different distros
- Repository setup
- Configuration deployment
- Platform-specific differences

---

### 4. **Health Check Validation**

#### Post-Installation Verification
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
./scripts/validation/health-check.sh
```

**What it checks:**
- All installed applications and tools
- Configuration file linking
- Shell setup and plugins
- Git configuration
- Development tools availability
- Desktop environment (Linux)
- Font installation
- Neovim health

#### Expected Output:
```
[STEP] Checking shell configuration...
âœ“ zsh is installed
âœ“ ~/.zshrc (symlinked)
[STEP] Checking development tools...
âœ“ lazygit (Terminal Git UI) - 0.40.2
âœ“ fastfetch (Modern system info tool) - 2.3.3
...
ðŸŽ‰ All checks passed! Your dotfiles installation is healthy.
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Package Manager Issues
```bash
# If yq is missing
sudo apt install yq  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install yq       # macOS

# If package conflicts occur
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  # Update package lists
```

### Configuration Issues
```bash
# If symlinks are broken
./install.sh --shell  # Re-run component installation

# If shell doesn't load properly
zsh -c "source ~/.zshrc"  # Test configuration manually
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# If Docker group membership doesn't work
newgrp docker  # Activate group membership
# Or logout/login

# If sudo issues occur
sudo -v  # Refresh sudo credentials
```

---

## âš¡ Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Validate everything
./install.sh --test

# Test installation (safe)
./install.sh --minimal --dry-run --non-interactive

# Health check after installation
./scripts/validation/health-check.sh

# Test shell configuration
zsh -c "source ~/.zshrc && echo 'OK'"

# Test Catppuccin theme consistency
grep -r "#24273a" config/  # Should find base color in configs

# Test Docker cross-platform
./scripts/test/docker-test.sh all shell
```
